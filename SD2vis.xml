      <param mustexist="false" name="SDchannels" type="any">
	<description>List of two integers, which give the range of spectral channels (in the image) that will be converted into visibilities. If not a 2-element list, the whole image is taken.</description>

	<value>500</value>
      </param>

      <param mustexist="false" name="inputvis" type="path">
	<description>Measurement set with the visibilities that are going to be concatenated with the Total-Power data. This is used to set the appropriate weights to the Total-Power visibilities, and to set the pointings (which will be the same as those in inputvis).</description>

      <param mustexist="false" name="inputchan" type="any">
	<description>Range of channels with strong line emission, which will be used to compute the Total-Power / interferometry scaling and weights.

	<description>Over-resolution factor when unconvolving the Total-Power image (from the Total-Power beam). Default value will use the exact beam given in the header of the Total-Power image. Higher values will unconvolve narrower beams (i.e., over-resolve).</description>

      <param mustexist="false" name="scale" type="any">
	<description>Scaling factor for the amplitudes of the Total-Power data. If you set over_resolve != 1.0, you should set scale = 1./(over_resolve)**2, to conserve the total flux density in the image. If scale is negative, the scaling factor will be derived automatically, by comparing baselines shorter than abs(scale) (in meters). E.g., if scale = -12.0, all baselines shorter than 12m will be used to estimate the scaling factor between the Total Power and the interferometric data. </description>

      <param mustexist="false" name="Python_DFT" type="bool">
	<description>If a FITS file is used, it is possible to encounter a (quite) silly CASA error related to the sm tool. In such a case, set this to True, so that SD2vis will compute the DFT by itself (much slower approach, since it has to use some Python loops). Notice, though, that you may encounter problems with the Primary Beam correction (due to another CASA limitation, related to hardcoded PBs) when Python_DFT=True</description>

    <returns type="bool"/>
    <example>
This task reads a Single Dish image, unconvolves the Primary Beam (by applying an FFT-based filter), and generates a synthetic measurement set with baselines distributed following a random Gaussian distribution in UV space. This distribution is centered at the origin and has a width similar to the FT of the Single Dish aperture.

The visibility values are computed using Direct Fourier Transform, as coded in the sm tool (or directly using Python code, if the sm tool fails, as it usually happens when dealing with FITS image files).

The output of this task can then be concatenated to an interferometric dataset, for a proper deconvolution.

The user is asked to check the synthetic visibilities with plotms, prior to the concatenation, to check for possible problems or artifacts. For instance, if the beam information given in the header of the image is slightly wider than the true convolving beam in the image, the user will see that the visibilities may INCREASE as a function of baseline length, especially for the longest baselines (i.e., close to SDbaseline). If that is the case, the user can fine-tune the beam deconvolution in the image by setting the &quot;over_resolve&quot; keyword.
